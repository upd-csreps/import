			<h2 class="font-weight-bold">Terms and conditions</h2>
			<p>These terms and conditions ("Terms", "Agreement") are an agreement between Application Developers ("Application Developers", "us", "we" or "our") and you ("User", "you" or "your"). This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the <span class="font-weight-bold">import <span class="import-font-primary">*</span></span> application and any of its products or services (collectively, "Application" or "Services").</p>
			
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Accounts and membership</h3>
			<p>If you create an account in the Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and use our Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>
			
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold">User content</h3>
			<p>We do not own any data, information or material ("Content") that you submit in the Application in the course of using the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all submitted Content. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review Content in the Application submitted or created using our Services by you. Unless specifically permitted by you, your use of the Application does not grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose. But you grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and perform the Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable.</p>
			
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Backups</h3>
			<p>We perform regular backups of the Content and will do our best to ensure completeness and accuracy of these backups. In the event of the hardware failure or data loss we will restore backups automatically to minimize the impact and downtime.</p>
			
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Links to other applications</h3>
			<p>Although this Application may link to other applications, we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked application, unless specifically stated herein. Some of the links in the Application may be "affiliate links". This means if you click on the link and purchase an item, Application Developers will receive an affiliate commission. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their applications. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third-parties.
