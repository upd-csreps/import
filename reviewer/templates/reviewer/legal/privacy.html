			<h2 class="font-weight-bold">Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Application Developers ("Application Developers", "we", "us" or "our") collect, protect and use the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide in the <span class="font-weight-bold">import <span class="import-font-primary">*</span></span> application and any of its products or services (collectively, "Application" or "Services").</p>
			<p>It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
			
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Automatic collection of information</h3>
			<p>When you open the Application our servers automatically record information that your device sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address and location, device name and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, information you search for in our Application, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
			<p>Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Application traffic and usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
			
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Collection of personal information</h3>
			<p>You can visit the Application without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the Application's features, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content,  or fill any online forms in the Application.  When required, this information may include the following:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Personal details such as name, academic information, etc.</li>

			<p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Application's features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>
			
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Managing personal information</h3>
			<p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Application or Services change.

If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so on the settings page of your account in the Application or simply by contacting us.</p>
			
			<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Storing personal information</h3>
			<p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
